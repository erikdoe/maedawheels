# Maeda Wheels

This is a screensaver I wrote in 2001 after reading <a href="http://www.maedastudio.com/2001/maedamedia/index.php?category=all&next=exists&prev=exists&this=maedamedia">MAEDA@MEDIA</a>. At the time my PowerBook Pismo was a bit too slow to render this at acceptable framerates but now it looks as lovely as it was intended.
  
The actual animation depends on the mouse position. So, be surprised by new patterns each time, or move the mouse while the screen saver is active.
